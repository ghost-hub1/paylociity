                                              You will not, directly, or indirectly, export, re-export, or release any
                                              API to, or make any API accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to
                                              which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or
                                              regulation. You will comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations,
                                              and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any
                                              necessary export license or other governmental approval), before
                                              exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making any API available
                                              outside the US.</p>
                                            <p>14. US Government Rights. Each API is a "commercial product" as that term
                                              is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer
                                              software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms
                                              are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the
                                              US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights
                                              with respect to an API as are granted to all other end users under
                                              license, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. §
                                              227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors,
                                              or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government
                                              licensees and their contractors.</p>
                                            <p>15. Modifications. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in
                                              our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time. You will
                                              be notified of modifications through notifications or posts on our

                                              becoming familiar with any such modifications. However, any changes to the
                                              dispute resolution provisions set out in Section 17 will not apply to any

                                            <p>16. Governing Law. This agreement is governed by and construed in
                                              accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois without giving
                                              effect to any choice of conflict of law provision or rule that would
                                              require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other
                                              than those of the State of Illinois.</p>
                                            <p>17. Dispute Resolution.</p>

                                              <li>Escalation Process. If the parties cannot resolve any dispute in any
                                                way arising from or relating to this Agreement, including any API
                                                Document, order form, or other transaction document associated herewith
                                                (each a <b>“Dispute”</b>), by mutual agreement, then either party shall
                                                be entitled to escalate the matter to the appropriate executive
                                                management level within each party’s organization to resolve such
                                                Dispute. Executive management of each party will use commercially
                                                reasonable efforts to resolve the Dispute within ten (10) calendar days
                                                of escalation.</li>
                                              <li>Arbitration. If a Dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of both
                                                parties in accordance with Section 17(a), within thirty (30) calendar
                                                days from the date of escalation, the Parties will submit such Dispute
                                                to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in
                                                accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the
                                                award rendered may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                                                Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
                                                experience with software development agreements. Time is of the essence
                                                for any arbitration under this agreement, and arbitration hearings shall
                                                take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within
                                                one hundred twenty (120) days. The arbitrator shall agree to these
                                                limits before accepting an appointment. Pursuant to the Commercial
                                                Arbitration Rules, the arbitrator will have the authority to allocate
                                                the costs of the arbitration process among the Parties but will only
                                                have the authority to allocate attorneys' fees if a particular law
                                                permits them to do so. Except as may be required by law, neither a party
                                                nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any
                                                arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both Parties.
                                                Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company reserves the right to seek
                                                injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>

                                            <p>18. Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and

                                                Developers must assume all costs set forth in the Integration Agreement.
                                                Upon reasonable request by the Developer, Paylocity will provide an

                                                Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and
                                                judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court of competent
                                                jurisdiction. Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator. The
                                                arbitrator shall have experience with software and developer agreements.
                                                Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement, and
                                                arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing
                                                and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days. The arbitrator
                                                shall agree to these limits before accepting an appointment. Pursuant to
                                                the Commercial Arbitration Rules, the arbitrator will have the authority
                                                to allocate the costs of the arbitration process among the parties but
                                                will only have the authority to allocate attorneys' fees if a particular
                                                law permits them to do so. Except as may be required by law, neither a
                                                party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results

                                                Parties. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue of such
